    Takes a list of the cards in the playerâ€™s hand as argument, as well as the card currently at
    the top of the discard pile (if there is no card in the discard pile, None is given instead).
    Returns either 'stock' or 'discard' at random (unless there is no top card in the discard
    pile, in which case only 'stock' is returned).
